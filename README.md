# Tableau

### `Terms`

`Row` | `Observation` 

`Column` | `Field`

### `Dimensions`  
- `Qualitative` values like `Names`, `Dates`, `Category` or `Geographical` Data.
-  `Dimension` values never change.
-  `Dimensions` are used to `categorize`, `segment`, and `reveal` the details in your data.
-  `Dimensions` affect the `level` of detail in the view. 
-  `Dimensions` are `independent` variables.

### `Measures`  
- `Quantitative` values like `Quantity`, `Currency`, `Profit` or `Revenue`
- `Measure` values changes on the basis of dimension selected or any filters applied.
- `Measures` can be `aggregated`
- `Tableau` applies an `aggregation` to the measure by default.
-  `Measures` are `dependent` variables.

### `Green (Continuous) vs Blue (Discrete)`
- `Discrete Dimension` or `Continuous Measure` are `most` common.
- `Continuous Dimension` or `Discrete Measure` are `less` common.
- `Green` measures and dimensions are `continuous`
- `Blue` measures and dimensions are `discrete`
- `Continuous` field values are treated as an `infinite`
- `Continuous` fields add `axes` to the view.
- `Discrete` values are treated as `finite` 
- `Discrete` fields add `headers` to the view.
