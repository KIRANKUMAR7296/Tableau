# Tableau Prep

- Takes the process of `cleansing` and `transforming` data.
- `Data Cleansing` + `Aggregation` + `Pivoting` + `Joins` + `Union` ...
- All of these are codified using visual indicators.
- Always show data in a clean and summarized interface.
- Summary explaining how the operation you are doing effects your data.
- `Tableview` shows the result.
